Using the packages tidyr, dplyr
========================================================
During a ten week sensory experiment, 12 individuals were asked to assess taste of french fries on several scales (how potato-y, buttery, grassy, rancid, paint-y do the fries taste?)

French fries were fried in one of three different oils, and each week individuals had to assess six batches of french fries (all three oils, replicated twice)
```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
library(xtable)
library(reshape2)
library(tidyr)

print(xtable(head(french_fries)), comment = FALSE)
```

This format is not ideal for data analysis
========================================================
What code would be needed to plot each of the ratings over time as a different color?
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

french_sub <- french_fries[french_fries$time == 10,]

qplot("1_potato", potato, data = french_sub, fill = I("red"), geom = "boxplot") +
    geom_boxplot(aes(x = "2_buttery", y = buttery), fill = I("orange")) +
    geom_boxplot(aes(x = "3_grassy", y = grassy), fill = I("yellow")) +
    geom_boxplot(aes(x = "4_rancid", y = rancid), fill = I("green")) +
    geom_boxplot(aes(x = "5_painty", y = painty), fill = I("blue")) +
    xlab("variable") + ylab("rating")
```

The Plot
========================================================
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

french_sub <- french_fries[french_fries$time == 10,]

qplot("1_potato", potato, data = french_sub, fill = I("red"), geom = "boxplot") +
    geom_boxplot(aes(x = "2_buttery", y = buttery), fill = I("orange")) +
    geom_boxplot(aes(x = "3_grassy", y = grassy), fill = I("yellow")) +
    geom_boxplot(aes(x = "4_rancid", y = rancid), fill = I("green")) +
    geom_boxplot(aes(x = "5_painty", y = painty), fill = I("blue")) +
    xlab("variable") + ylab("rating")
```

What we have and what we want
========================================================
We want to change this **wide format**:

![Wide Format](figures/tableoverview.png)

***
to this **long format**:

![Long Format](figures/tablelong.png)

Gathering
========================================================
- When gathering, you need to specify the **keys** (identifiers) and the **values** (measures).

Keys/Identifiers:
- Identify a record (must be unique)
- Example: Indices on an random variable
- Fixed by design of experiment (known in advance)
- May be single or composite (may have one or more variables)

Values/Measures:
- Collected during the experiment (not known in advance)
- Usually numeric quantities

Gathering the French Fry Data
========================================================
```{r}
french_fries_long <- gather(french_fries, key = variable, value = rating, potato:painty)

head(french_fries_long)
```

Let's Reconstruct our Plot
========================================================
```{r, fig.show='hide'}
french_fries_long_sub <- french_fries_long[
  french_fries_long$time == 10,]

qplot(variable, rating, data = french_fries_long_sub, fill = variable, geom = "boxplot")
```

***
```{r, echo=FALSE}
qplot(variable, rating, data = french_fries_long_sub, fill = variable, geom = "boxplot")
```

Long to Wide
========================================================
In certain applications, we may wish to take a long dataset and convert it to a wide dataset (Perhaps displaying in a table).

```{r}
head(french_fries_long)
```

Spread
========================================================
We use the **spread** function from tidyr to do this:

```{r}
french_fries_wide <- spread(french_fries_long, key = variable, value = rating)

head(french_fries_wide)
```

YOUR TURN
========================================================
1. Read in the billboard top 100 music data, which contains N'Sync and Backstreet Boys songs that entered the billboard charts in the year 2000
```{r}
billboard <- read.csv("data/billboard.csv")
```
2. Use ``tidyr`` to convert this data into a long format appropriate for plotting a time series (date on the x axis, chart position on the y axis)
3. Use ``ggplot2`` to create this time series plot:
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=15, fig.height=5}
long_billboard <- gather(billboard, key = week, value = rank, X1:X76)
long_billboard$week <- as.numeric(gsub("X", "", long_billboard$week))

qplot(week, rank, data = long_billboard, geom = "line", colour = artist, group = track)
```

The Split-Apply-Combine Approach
========================================================
- *Split* a dataset into many smaller sub-datasets
- *Apply* some function to each sub-dataset to compute a result
- *Combine* the results of the function calls into a one dataset

Split-Apply-Combine in dplyr
========================================================
```{r}
library(dplyr)

french_fries_split <- group_by(french_fries_long, variable) # SPLIT
french_fries_apply <- summarise(french_fries_split, rating = mean(rating, na.rm = TRUE)) # APPLY + COMBINE
french_fries_apply
```

The pipe operator
========================================================
- dplyr allows us to chain together these data analysis tasks using the `%>%` (pipe) operator
- `x %>% f(y)` is shorthand for `f(x, y)`
- Example:

```{r}
french_fries %>%
    gather(key = variable, value = rating, potato:painty) %>%
    group_by(variable) %>%
    summarise(rating = mean(rating, na.rm = TRUE))
```

dplyr verbs
========================================================
There are five primary dplyr **verbs**, representing distinct data analysis tasks:

- Filter: Remove the rows of a data frame, producing subsets
- Arrange: Reorder the rows of a data frame
- Select: Select particular columns of a data frame
- Mutate: Add new columns that are functions of existing columns
- Summarise: Create collapsed summaries of a data frame
    
Filter
========================================================
```{r}
french_fries %>%
    filter(subject == 3, time == 1)
```

Arrange
========================================================
```{r}
french_fries %>%
    arrange(desc(rancid)) %>%
    head
```

Select
========================================================
```{r}
french_fries %>%
    select(time, treatment, subject, rep, potato) %>%
    head
```

Summarise
========================================================
```{r}
french_fries %>%
    group_by(time, treatment) %>%
    summarise(mean_rancid = mean(rancid), sd_rancid = sd(rancid))
```

YOUR TURN
========================================================
Read in the flights data:
```{r}
flights <- read.csv("data/flights.csv")
```
This dataset contains information on over 300,000 flights that departed from New York City in the year 2013.

1. Using dplyr and the pipe operator, create a data frame consisting of the average arrival delay (``arr_delay``) based on the destination airport (``dest``). Sort this data frame in descending order, so the destination airport with the largest delay is first.
2. Find out the most used airports for each airline carrier.

Dates and Times
========================================================
Dates are deceptively hard to work with in R.

**Example**: 02/05/2012. Is it February 5th, or May 2nd?

Other things are difficult too:

- Time zones
- POSIXct format in base R is challenging

The **lubridate** package helps tackle some of these issues.

Basic Lubridate Use
========================================================
```{r, results='hold'}
library(lubridate)

now()
today()
now() + hours(4)
today() - days(2)
```

Parsing Dates
========================================================
```{r, results='hold'}
ymd("2013-05-14")
mdy("05/14/2013")
dmy("14052013")
ymd_hms("2013:05:14 14:50:30", tz = "America/Chicago")
```

YOUR TURN
========================================================
1. Using the ``flights`` data, create a new column Date using lubridate. You will need to paste together the columns year, month, and day in order to do this. See the ``paste`` function.
2. Use dplyr to calculate the average departure delay for each date.
3. Plot a time series of the date versus the average departure delay

***
```{r, echo=FALSE}
flights$date <- ymd(paste(flights$year, flights$month, flights$day, sep = "-"))
delay.dat <- flights %>% group_by(date) %>% summarise(dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))

qplot(date, dep_delay, geom = "line", data = delay.dat)
```
