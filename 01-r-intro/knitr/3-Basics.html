## Even More Functions

- Exponentiation 
    - `exp(x)`
- Logarithms
    - `log(x)`
    - `log(x, base = 10)`
- Trigonometric functions
    - `sin(x)`
    - `asin(x)`
    - `cos(x)`
    - `tan(x)`
    
---
## Creating Variables

We can create variables using the assignment operator `&lt;-`:


```r
x &lt;- 5
MyAge &lt;- 26
```

We can then perform any of the functions on the variables:


```r
log(x)
```

```
## [1] 1.609438
```

```r
MyAge^2
```

```
## [1] 676
```

---
## Rules for Variable Creation

- Variable names can't start with a number

- Variables in `R` are case-sensitive

- Some common letters are used internally by R and should be avoided as variable names (c, q, t, C, D, F, T, I)

- There are reserved words that R won't let you use for variable names. (for, in, while, if, else, repeat, break, next)

- R *will* let you use the name of a predefined function.  Try not to overwrite those though!

---
## Vectors

A variable does not need to be a single value. We can create a **vector** using the `c` (combine) function:


```r
y &lt;- c(1, 5, 3, 2)
```

Operations will then be done element-wise:


```r
y / 2
```

```
## [1] 0.5 2.5 1.5 1.0
```

---
## Getting Help

We will talk MUCH more about vectors in a bit, but for now, let's talk about a couple ways to get help. The primary function to use is the `help` function. Just pass in the name of the function you need help with:


```r
help(head)
```

The `?` function also works:


```r
?head
```

Googling for help can be difficult at first. You might need to search for R + CRAN + \&lt;your query\&gt; to get good results

Stackoverflow is VERY helpful

---
## Getting Help

**R Reference Card **

We will pass you out a copy, but you can download the reference card from:

http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Short-refcard.pdf

Having this open or printed off and near you while working is helpful.

&lt;/br&gt;

**Rstudio cheatsheets**

The Rstudio cheatsheets are VERY helpful.

https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/

## Your Turn

Using the R Reference Card (and the Help pages, if needed), do the following:

Find out how many rows and columns the `iris` data set has. Figure out at least 2 ways to do this.

**Hint**: "Variable Information" section on the first page of the reference card!

Use the `rep` function to construct the following vector: `1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5`

**Hint**: "Data Creation" section of the reference card

Use `rep` to construct this vector: `1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5`

---
## Data Frames: Introduction

- `tips` is a data frame.

- Data frames hold data sets

- Not every column need be the same type - like an Excel spreadsheet

- Each column in a data frame is a vector &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; - so each column needs to have values that are all the same type. 

- We can access different columns using the `$` operator.


```r
tip &lt;- tips$tip
bill &lt;- tips$total_bill
```

.footnote[
[1] a column can also be a list! This is a more advanced topic that will be saved for later.
]
---
## More about Vectors

A vector is a list of values that are all the same type. We have seen that we can create them using the `c` or the `rep` function. We can also use the `:` operator if we wish to create consecutive values:


```r
a &lt;- 10:15
a
```

```
## [1] 10 11 12 13 14 15
```

We can extract the different elements of the vector like so:


```r
bill[3]
```

```
## [1] 21.01
```

---
## Indexing Vectors

We saw that we can access individual elements of the vector. But **indexing** is a lot more powerful than that:


```r
head(tip)
```

```
## [1] 1.01 1.66 3.50 3.31 3.61 4.71
```

```r
tip[c(1, 3, 5)]
```

```
## [1] 1.01 3.50 3.61
```

```r
tip[1:5]
```

```
## [1] 1.01 1.66 3.50 3.31 3.61
```

---
## Logical Values

- R has built in support for logical values

- TRUE and FALSE are built in.  T (for TRUE) and F (for FALSE) are supported but can be modified

- Logicals can result from a comparison using
    - `&lt;` : "less than"
    - `&gt;` : "greater than"
    - `&lt;=` : "less than or equal to"
    - `&gt;=` : "greater than or equal to"
    - `==` : "is equal to"
    - `!=` : "not equal to"
    
---
## Indexing with Logicals

We can index vectors using logical values as well:


```r
x &lt;- c(2, 3, 5, 7)
x[c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)]
```

```
## [1] 2 7
```

```r
x &gt; 3.5
```

```
## [1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE
```

```r
x[x &gt; 3.5]
```

```
## [1] 5 7
```

---
## Logical Examples


```r
rate &lt;- tips$rate
head(rate)
```

```
## [1] 0.05944673 0.16054159 0.16658734 0.13978041 0.14680765 0.18623962
```

```r
sad_tip &lt;- rate &lt; 0.10
rate[sad_tip]
```

```
##  [1] 0.05944673 0.07180385 0.07892660 0.05679667 0.09935739 0.05643341

```

## Your Turn 

1. Find out how many people tipped over 20%.

**Hint**: if you use the `sum` function on a logical vector, it'll return how many TRUEs are in the vector:


```r
sum(c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE))
```

```
## [1] 3
```

2. **More Challenging**: Calculate the sum of the total bills of anyone who tipped over 20%

---
## Element-wise Logical Operators

- `&amp;` (elementwise AND)
- `|` (elementwise OR)


```r
c(T, T, F, F) &amp; c(T, F, T, F)
```

```
## [1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE
```

```r
c(T, T, F, F) | c(T, F, T, F)
```

```
## [1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE
```

```r
# Which are big bills with a poor tip rate?
id &lt;- (bill &gt; 40 &amp; rate &lt; .10)
tips[id,]
```

```
##     total_bill tip    sex smoker day   time size       rate
## 103      44.30 2.5 Female    Yes Sat Dinner    3 0.05643341
## 183      45.35 3.5   Male    Yes Sun Dinner    3 0.07717751
## 185      40.55 3.0   Male    Yes Sun Dinner    2 0.07398274
```

---

## Modifying Vectors

We can modify vectors using indexing as well:


```r
x &lt;- bill[1:5]
x
```

```
## [1] 16.99 10.34 21.01 23.68 24.59
```

```r
x[1] &lt;- 20
x
```

```
## [1] 20.00 10.34 21.01 23.68 24.59
```

---
## Vector Elements

Elements of a vector must all be the same type:


```r
head(rate)
```

```
## [1] 0.05944673 0.16054159 0.16658734 0.13978041 0.14680765 0.18623962
```

```r
rate[sad_tip] &lt;- ":-("
head(rate)
```

```
## [1] ":-("               "0.160541586073501" "0.166587339362208"
## [4] "0.139780405405405" "0.146807645384303" "0.186239620403321"
```

By changing a value to a string, all the other values were also changed.

---
## Data Types in R

- Can use `mode` or `class` to find out information about variables

- `str` is useful to find information about the structure of your data

- Many data types: numeric, integer, character, Date, and factor most common
    

```r
str(tips)
```

```
## 'data.frame':	244 obs. of  8 variables:
##  $ total_bill: num  17 10.3 21 23.7 24.6 ...
##  $ tip       : num  1.01 1.66 3.5 3.31 3.61 4.71 2 3.12 1.96 3.23 ...
##  $ sex       : Factor w/ 2 levels "Female","Male": 1 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 2 ...
##  $ smoker    : Factor w/ 2 levels "No","Yes": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
##  $ day       : Factor w/ 4 levels "Fri","Sat","Sun",..: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ...
##  $ time      : Factor w/ 2 levels "Dinner","Lunch": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
##  $ size      : int  2 3 3 2 4 4 2 4 2 2 ...
##  $ rate      : num  0.0594 0.1605 0.1666 0.1398 0.1468 ...
```

---
## Converting Between Types

We can convert between different types using the `as` series of functions:


```r
size &lt;- head(tips$size)
size
```

```
## [1] 2 3 3 2 4 4
```

```r
as.character(size)
```

```
## [1] "2" "3" "3" "2" "4" "4"
```

```r
as.numeric("2")
```

```
## [1] 2
```

---
## Some useful functions

There are a whole variety of useful functions to operate on vectors. 

A couple of the more common ones are `length`, which returns the length (number of elements) of a vector, and `sum`, which adds up all the elements of a vector.


```r
x &lt;- tip[1:5]
length(x)
```

```
## [1] 5
```

```r
sum(x)
```

```
## [1] 13.09
```

---
## Statistical Functions

Using the basic functions we've learned it wouldn't be hard to compute some basic statistics.


```r
(n &lt;- length(tip))
```

```
## [1] 244
```

```r
(meantip &lt;- sum(tip) / n)
```

```
## [1] 2.998279
```

```r
(standdev &lt;- sqrt(sum((tip - meantip)^2) / (n - 1)))
```

```
## [1] 1.383638
```

But we don't have to.

---
## Built-in Statistical Functions


```r
mean(tip)
```

```
## [1] 2.998279
```

```r
sd(tip)
```

```
## [1] 1.383638
```

```r
summary(tip)
```

```
##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##   1.000   2.000   2.900   2.998   3.562  10.000
```

```r
quantile(tip, c(.025, .975))
```

```
##   2.5%  97.5% 
## 1.1760 6.4625
```

## Your Turn

1. Read up on the diamonds dataset (`?diamonds`)

2. Plot price by carat (use qplot - go back to the motivating example for help with the syntax)

3. Create a variable `ppc` for price/carat. Store this variable as a column in the diamonds data

4. Make a histogram of all ppc values that exceed $10000 per carat.

5. Explore any other interesting relationships you find
